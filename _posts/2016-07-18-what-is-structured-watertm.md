  Structured Water is created by the natural action of water in nature.
  http://www.NaturalActionTechnologies.com The natural action of water tumbling
  over rocks, down waterfalls, flowing through twists and turns as it actively
  descends a mountain actually structures water. Water molecules are free to
  move and "dance with nature" in an energetically alive, fresh and vibrant
  manner.
