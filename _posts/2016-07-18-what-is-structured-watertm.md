  Structured Water is created by the natural action of water in nature. The
  natural action of water tumbling over rocks, down waterfalls, flowing through
  twists and turns as it actively descends a mountain actually structures water.
  Water molecules are free to move and "dance with nature" in an energetically
  alive, fresh and vibrant manner.
